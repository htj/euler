-- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
--
--The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
--
--Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
--numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

--Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
--natural numbers and the square of the sum.
